Using Python's Pandas, model_selection, logistic regression and StandardScaler libraries in sklearn, I analysed a dataset that represented word and character frequencies in order to find patterns when it comes to spam detection. I got myself familiar with the dataset by using pandas to analyze the different columns, and then I transformed and manipulated the data by scaling it in order to be able to use the logistic regression model on the data. Later, I tried the random forest classifier model, which ended up giving a way better score. If anything I belive this score to be overfit, which would mean that I should try a less complex model.
